# The Snuts

For my User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project I have decided to create a website for one of my favourite new bands The Snuts. 
You can view my project [here](https://jimev87.github.io/MS1/)

## UX
 
 The Snuts are a classic example of a British indie-rock band but with an energy and style completely new and unique.  I have designed this website to reflect that energy and
 style whilst still delivering the main project goals, those being to promotote the band to new and old fans alike with an informative and easily navigated website.

 The colour scheme was inspired by the band's previous album artwork and the signature colours used on their tour which are instantly recognisalble to their fans. I took great care 
 in selecting the exact colours by using https://imagecolorpicker.com/en/  to pick out the exact RGB colour codes, these being:
 - #fff1d7 selected from the artwork for their album Mixtape empty
 - #e8b015, #ed1894, #123680 and #189e95 selected from the band's promo poster for their 2021 tour

By combining these colours I have created a consistant theme that reflects the energy of the band and also in-keeps with their established identity and branding.  The Ranchers font 
that I have selected to be used on the sites headings is also consistant with previous promotions released by the band, so that provides another link to The Snuts brand.  I selected 
two further fonts from Google Fonts; Caveat which was used to give style to review quotes, and Roboto Slab which I used for clarity on text content.

### Wireframes

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to design wireframes for the [Home](https://github.com/JimEv87/MS1/blob/master/assets/wireframes/MS1wireframe1.png), [About](https://github.com/JimEv87/MS1/blob/master/assets/wireframes/MS1wireframe2.png), 
[Tour](https://github.com/JimEv87/MS1/blob/master/assets/wireframes/MS1wireframe3.png), [Music](https://github.com/JimEv87/MS1/blob/master/assets/wireframes/MS1wireframe4.png) and [Gallery](https://github.com/JimEv87/MS1/blob/master/assets/wireframes/MS1wireframe5.png)
pages.


## Features

### Heading

There is a strong and eye catching header that remains at the top of the browser on every page to maintain a consistant style and also aid intuative navigation. The header consists
of the band name, which also acts as a link to the Home page, above four dual function over-sized navigation links which navigate the website and also imprint the band’s signature
stylings onto every page. Each navigation link becomes highlighted with a subtle underline when that page is in use, which assists the user in knowing their place on the website.

### Footer

Like the header, the footer provides style as well as function so it is pinned to the bottom of the browser on every page.  Coloured in a strong & vibrant pink, the brightest of 
the band's signature colours, the footer brings much needed colour and energy to the website.  
The footer contains:
- a link to the band's merchandise shop https://thesnuts.bigcartel.com/
- links to the band's social media pages using universally recognised icons provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- has a link to the contact page (non-functioning).  

### Home Page

- An image featuring the artwork from the band's first album.  Clicking the image takes the user to an external website where the album can be purchased.
- Review quotes
- Links to music industry campaign's and charity appeals  

### About Page

- Information about the band 
- Two promotional pictures of the band

### Tour Page

- An image of the band's promotion of their 2021 tour
