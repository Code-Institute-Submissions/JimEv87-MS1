# The Snuts

For my User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project I have decided to create a website for one of my favourite new bands The Snuts. 
You can view my project [here](https://jimev87.github.io/MS1/)

## UX
 
 The Snuts are a classic example of a British indie-rock band but with an energy and style completely new and unique.  I have designed this website to reflect that energy and
 style whilst still delivering the main project goals, those being to promotote the band to new and old fans alike with an informative and easily navigated website.

 The colour scheme was inspired by the band's previous album artwork and the signature colours used on their tour which are instantly recognisalble to their fans. I took great care 
 in selecting the exact colours by using https://imagecolorpicker.com/en/  to pick out the exact RGB colour codes, these being:
 - #fff1d7 selected from the artwork for their album Mixtape empty
 - #e8b015, #ed1894, #123680 and #189e95 selected from the band's promo poster for their 2021 tour

By combining these colours I have created a consistant theme that reflects the energy of the band and also in-keeps with their established identity and branding.  The Ranchers font 
that I have selected to be used on the sites headings is also consistant with previous promotions released by the band, so that provides another link to The Snuts brand.  I selected 
two further fonts from Google Fonts; Caveat which was used to give style to review quotes, and Roboto Slab which I used for clarity on text content.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name,
 a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will 
want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users
 to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing
 process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
